99translations.com :: Ruby Tools

This package is set of rake tasks to automate translation of Ruby (on Rails) applications. 

The plugin installs configuration file 'config/trans.yml' which defines API key that you can get on your project page at 99translations.com and list of translation files.

-----------------------------------------
api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
sample_file:
  path: path/to/your/master/file
  type: yml
  translations:
    de: path/to/your/german/translation
    es: path/to/your/spanish/translation
sample_file2:
  path: another/path
  type: yml
  translations:
    de: another/path/de
    es: another/path/es
-----------------------------------------

In this example 'sample_file' and 'sample_file2' are 2 translation files. Parameter 'path' defines relative path to their location, parameter 'type' can be only of 'yml', 'gettext', 'java' , 'java_utf8' and describes format of the file, translations in form 'locale: path' are listed under 'translations' key.

You have to customize this file before using the plugin. 

As soon as your configuration is done you can use 2 rake tasks 'trans:upload' and 'trans:download'. Upload task pushes master translation files to the server (99translations.com) so external translators can start working on it. Download task gets translations from the server and places them under listed locations.

Example:

rake trans:upload
rake trans:download
